This application is complied using a modfied version of devkitPPC r21. The included gcc 4.5.1 produces
an error when compiling with the parameter -Os, but that is required to get the GC low plugin below 6KB.
In order to compile this project(the GC part to be precise), you need to have the files from gcc 4.4.3 in
your devkitPPC folder. (no need to delete gcc 4.5.1)
